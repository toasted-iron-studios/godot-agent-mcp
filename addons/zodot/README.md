### ZODOT-ISH

This is a heavily modified and domain-specific version of the Zodot library (https://github.com/rametta/zodot), fitted closely to MCP parameter specification for tools.

We've done away with many of the complex structs that are not compatible with MCP to reduce cognitive overhead of using the library.
